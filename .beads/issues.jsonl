{"id":"agui-9kc","title":"Implement async/sync bridge for real Claude API integration","description":"Complete the Claude API integration by implementing a proper async/sync bridge between the tokio-based ClaudeClient and GPUI's synchronous rendering.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIssue agui-t1o laid the groundwork for Claude API integration, but hit an architectural blocker: GPUI is synchronous while Claude API is async. The ClaudeClient, EventDispatcher, and conversation management are all implemented and working, but can't be integrated due to the async/sync boundary.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\n✅ ClaudeClient fully implemented (src/claude/client.rs)\n✅ EventDispatcher handles streaming events (src/event_handler.rs)\n✅ Conversation management (src/claude/conversation.rs)\n✅ ClaudeClient initialized in AguiWindow\n✅ handle_message_submit() wired up (but doesn't compile)\n✅ Architecture documented in docs/guides/claude-integration-status.md\n\nBLOCKER:\nStreamTimeline and StageState don't implement Clone, so can't be passed to async tokio tasks. Need a message-passing architecture to bridge async Claude responses with sync GPUI updates.\n\nRECOMMENDED APPROACH (Option 2 from docs):\nUse tokio::sync::mpsc channel to send UI updates from async task to GPUI render loop:\n\n1. Create UIUpdate enum for all possible updates (AddMessage, UpdateStream, etc.)\n2. In handle_message_submit():\n   - Create mpsc channel\n   - Spawn async task with tx half\n   - Store rx half in AguiWindow\n3. In async task:\n   - Process Claude streaming events\n   - Send UIUpdate messages via channel\n4. In GPUI render loop:\n   - Poll channel with try_recv()\n   - Apply updates to local state\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS:\n1. Define UIUpdate enum in main.rs or new module\n2. Add channel receiver to AguiWindow struct\n3. Update handle_message_submit() to spawn async task with channel\n4. Process Claude stream in async task, sending updates\n5. Poll channel in render() and apply updates\n6. Handle cancellation (cancel button should drop channel)\n7. Re-enable input when stream completes\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- [ ] User can send messages to Claude API\n- [ ] Streaming responses update UI in real-time\n- [ ] Input is disabled while waiting, re-enabled after response\n- [ ] Cancel button works (stops in-flight request)\n- [ ] Error handling shows user-friendly messages\n- [ ] No panics or deadlocks\n- [ ] UI remains responsive during streaming\n\nFILES TO MODIFY:\n- crates/agui-desktop/src/main.rs (add channel, update handlers)\n- Consider: create src/ui_bridge.rs for channel types\n\nDEPENDENCIES:\n- Fix settings.rs compilation error first (separate issue needed)\n- Complete agui-t1o (mark as done or superseded)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","estimated_minutes":180,"created_at":"2026-01-09T22:35:12.199423716Z","created_by":"thedryhtscipe","updated_at":"2026-01-09T22:35:12.199423716Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agui-9kc","depends_on_id":"agui-oal","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-09T22:35:37.45539874Z","created_by":"thedryhtscipe"},{"issue_id":"agui-9kc","depends_on_id":"agui-t1o","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-09T22:35:57.483104106Z","created_by":"thedryhtscipe"}]}
